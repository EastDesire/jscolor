  All modern browsers are supported, including:
  Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer 7 and above and others...


* **Highly customizable:**
  Whether you need to change the color picker's size/colors or attach a function to the onchange event, jscolor can be fine-tuned to perfectly suit your web project.
