## Features


* **No framework needed** \
  jscolor.js is a completely self-sufficient JavaScript library consisting of only one file.
  It doesn't need any frameworks (jQuery, Dojo, MooTools etc.) But it can certainly coexist alongside them.


* **Cross-browser** \
  All modern browsers are supported, including:
  Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer 10 and above, and others...


* **Highly customizable** \
  jscolor provides many [configuration options](https://jscolor.com/docs/#doc-api-options). Whether you need to change color picker's size or colors, or attach a function to its onchange event, the configuration can be fine-tuned for your web project.


* **Mobile friendly** \
  With a built-in support for touch events, jscolor is designed to be easy to use on touch devices such as tablets and smartphones.
